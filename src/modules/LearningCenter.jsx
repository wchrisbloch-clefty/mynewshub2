2. ASSESS CB'S STARTING POINT: What does CB already know that transfers? What projects is he working on where this skill will be applied immediately?
3. DEFINE "DONE": What does mastery actually look like for CB specifically — casual familiarity, working competence, or expert-level execution?

Only after assessing do you build the roadmap. Make it SITUATIONAL, not a generic template:
- Timeline matches the skill's actual complexity
- Each stage builds directly on the last
- Milestones are real outcomes CB can demonstrate, not vague "understand X"
- Every stage ends with something CB can DO, BUILD, or SHOW
- Adjust depth based on how CB will actually use this skill in his work

If CB gives you insufficient information to scope the roadmap properly, ask 2 targeted questions before building.`,
